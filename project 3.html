<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;"> This is the <em> best </em> motherfucking website. You know why ? Let me show you</h1>
   <p> <span class="st"> Really, it is.</p> <p>&#128525;</p>
    <h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
  <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
  </p><p>
    <span class="wr">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>Let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
      <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href=https://www.ecosia.org/?c=fr>Google home page</a> ( much better, be eco friendly )
      </li>
      <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
      <li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
      <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <big>well, kind of</big></li>
      <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
      <li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
      <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a> but we still are big bossss so let's try : </li>
      <li> java script can make you feel like a boss : </li>
      <button type=button onclick="myFunction()">Don't you dare!</button>
      <p id="demo">yes.</p>
      <script>
        function myFunction() {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "daaaam it works!"; }
        </script>
    <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="sb">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="sv">black color</span> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
  <p>This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.</p>
  <p>Why?</p>
  <-- shiiiit I forgot why -->
  <ul>
    <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
    <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gTLD">gTLDs</a> available out there: .website</li>
    <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="http://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to do something cool too.</li>
    <li>It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)</li>
    <li>It runs on <a href="https://nginx.com/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apache Server</li>
    <li>It uses <a href="js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="http://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery</a> <b>/s</b></li>
    <li>It doesn't use a single media query <small>well, not really</small></li>
    <li>I'm sick of too much gift but look nice on website : <img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer man" style="width:48px;height:48px;"> 
     <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
     <li>It uses <a href="https://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
     <li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a></li>
     <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php">Accessible</a></li>
     <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">Github</a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
     <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:<p class="fakepre">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>
     </li><h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
     <p>Yeah, a <span class="foufoufou">#444 is cool</span> but a <span class="foufivfoufivfoufiv">#454545 is better</span>.</p>
     <p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.</p>
     <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
     <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>
     <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
     <img src="lorenzo.png" alt="lolo" width="460" height="345">
    <p>This is the best fucking rappeur of the world. Listen to nique la bac </figcaption></figure></div><div class="tleft">
      <p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span> so include some pictures to give a context.</p>
      <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
      <p>You see that fancy rappeur? He's happy, you should be too.</p></div></div>
      <h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
      <p>But this doesn't mean you should load your <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span> with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. <img src="hommer.png" alt="boring" width="50" height="25"> Remember the IPoAC users, <less>requests (with a small size) = faster load time!</less></p>
      <blockquote><span>Good design is as little design as possible.</span><author>Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</author></blockquote><p>That's not entirely true, look at that <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p><h2>Epilogue</h2><p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span></a> and the <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="mfw">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</span></a>.</p><p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still <span class="mfw">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</span>), so go check 'em out.</p><p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, <cite></cite>>they'll "make the web great again" </cite><span class="citneed"></span></p><h2>Author</h2><p>This website was created by an annoyed developer that can <a href="https://twitter.com/DenysVitali">be followed on Twitter</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/">followed on GitHub</a> or contacted <a href="https://denv.it/">here, on his ultra-minimalist website</a></p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<p> the picture was extract from ( who cares ??) and the author said <q>make some dirty shit, you won't wah it mam√®ne</q> . Thx for reading my website, <big>Madmax</big> 
, open an issue on GitHub</a> if you think that this decision goes against the rules (there is some rules ??)
of a good looking <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>.

Don't worry, it can be read in less than 30 seconds, unless you have some sort of reading disability - in that case, I'm wondering why you're still reading this text. Really. Stop. Please. I mean, seriously. Why are you still reading? because I'm too curiouse to not go till the end and maybe I'm crazy too....
